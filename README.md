## 🧭 Project Overview

“Go College” is a usability-focused navigation application built for freshmen and campus visitors. This project applies the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lifecycle to solve a real-world problem: **helping new students and guests confidently navigate the university campus**.

Through surveys, prototyping, and iterative design cycles, the app was developed with a user-centered design approach. It prioritizes **usability**, **accessibility**, and **real-time interaction** to provide accurate campus navigation based on class schedules or building names.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> Many freshmen face difficulty navigating their college campus, leading to confusion, late arrivals, and stress.

Our app addresses:
- Lack of campus familiarity
- Inefficient traditional maps
- Absence of route customization
- Need for real-time updates

## 🧪 HCI Lifecycle & Methodology

The app was built using an agile, iterative UX process based on the **HCI Lifecycle**:

1. **Understand Needs** – User interviews, feedback sessions, and survey analysis
2. **Design Solutions** – Paper prototypes and screen mockups
3. **Prototype Candidates** – Low and high-fidelity wireframes
4. **Evaluate UX** – Usability testing, refinement, and feedback loops
